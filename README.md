### 📋 Project Overview
This interactive dashboard was developed to analyze and visualize the factors influencing bike-sharing demand. It summarizes the key findings from a comprehensive data exploration, focusing on temporal patterns and environmental factors.

**Key Features:**
* **Hourly Rental Trends:** Comparison of peak usage times between working days and non-working days.
* **Seasonal & Weather Impact:** Visualization of how different weather conditions and seasons affect rider behavior.
* **Period Analysis:** Aggregated view of rentals across different times of the day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night).
* **Correlation Matrix:** An interactive heatmap exploring the relationships between numerical variables like temperature, humidity, and windspeed.

### 📁 Repository Structure
* `app.py`: The core Streamlit application script.
* `requirements.txt`: A list of Python libraries required to run the application.
* `train.csv`: The raw dataset containing historical bike rental data.
